Eyeloupe is the elegant Rails debug assistant. It helps you to debug your Rails application by providing a simple and elegant interface to view your incoming and outgoing requests (and a lot more to come).

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "eyeloupe"
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Install Eyeloupe migrations into your project:
```bash
$ rails eyeloupe:install:migrations
```

And run the migrations:
```bash
$ rails db:migrate
```

To access Eyeloupe dashboard you need to add the following route to your `config/routes.rb` file:
```ruby
mount Eyeloupe::Engine => "/eyeloupe"
```

## Configuration

This is an example of the configuration you can add to your `initializers/eyeloupe.rb` file:

```ruby
Eyeloupe.configure do |config|
  config.excluded_paths = %w[assets favicon.ico service-worker.js manifest.json]
  config.capture = Rails.env.development?
end
```

- `excluded_paths` is an array of paths you want to exclude from Eyeloupe capture. Eyeloupe adds these excluded paths to the default ones: ` %w[mini-profiler eyeloupe active_storage]`
- `capture` is a boolean to enable/disable Eyeloupe capture. By default, it's set to `true`.

## Usage

Eyeloupe is exclusively developed for the Rails framework.

You can use it in your development environment to debug your application but it's not recommended to use it in production.

### Auto-refresh

By activating auto-fresh, every _3 seconds_ the page will be refreshed to show you the latest data.

### Delete all data

You can delete all the data stored by Eyeloupe by clicking on the trash button.


## Q/A

### Why the request time is not the same on rack-mini-profiler ?

Eyeloupe is not a performance-oriented tool, the request time is the same you can view in the Rails log. If you want more details about your load time, you can use rack-mini-profiler along with Eyeloupe.

### Is this the Laravel Telescope for Rails ?

Yes, Eyeloupe is inspired by Laravel Telescope. A lot of people coming from Laravel are missing Telescope or looking for something similar, so Eyeloupe is here to fill this gap.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Exceptions - Track all the exceptions thrown by your application
- [ ] Custom links to the menu - To access all of your debug tool in one place (Sidekiq web, Mailhog, etc.)
